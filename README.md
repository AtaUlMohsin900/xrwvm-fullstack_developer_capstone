🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using Create React App, a popular setup tool for modern React applications.

📜 Available Scripts

Inside the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start

Starts the development server.
Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser to view the app.

The app reloads automatically when changes are made.

Any linting issues will be shown in the console.

npm test

Runs tests in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the testing section in the documentation for more details.

npm run build

Creates an optimized production build in the build folder.

React is bundled in production mode.

The output is minified and includes hashed filenames for efficient caching.

Your app will be ready for deployment.

For deployment guidance, see the Deployment documentation
.

npm run eject

⚠️ This action is irreversible!

Running this command will eject your app, giving you full control over the configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).

Useful if the default setup doesn’t meet your project’s needs.

After ejecting, all configuration files and dependencies are moved to your project directory.

Note: All other commands will still work, but they will now refer to the custom setup.

You likely won't need to eject for most small or mid-size projects, but it's there if you need deeper customization.
